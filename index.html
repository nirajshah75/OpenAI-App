Sorry, as an AI language model, I am not able to create visual designs or interfaces. However, I can provide you with some pointers for creating a landing page for an AI app that auto-creates apps by connecting data from different apps. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate the app's name and unique selling proposition (USP) above the fold, so visitors know what the app does and why it's different from other apps.

2. Provide a clear call-to-action (CTA) on the landing page that encourages visitors to sign up for the app. Make sure the CTA button stands out and is easy to find.

3. Use high-quality images and graphics that convey the app's functionality and benefits. You could use images of charts or diagrams showing how the app connects data from different apps and creates new ones.

4. Provide a brief overview of how the app works and the features it offers. Keep the language simple, concise, and easy to understand for those who might be less tech-savvy.

5. Include credible testimonials or customer reviews to build trust and credibility with potential users.

6. Ensure that the landing page is optimized for mobile devices and loads quickly. Many users access websites and apps on their smartphones, so make sure your page is mobile-friendly.

7. Use a clean and modern design that reflects the app's functionality and brand messaging.

These are some general tips that can help you create a compelling landing page for your AI app. Remember to test different variations and continuously iterate based on user feedback to find the optimal design that converts visitors into users.
